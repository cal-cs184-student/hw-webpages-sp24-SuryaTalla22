		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>In this Assignment, we cover rasterizing images. In order to do this, we break up the image into triangles, and feed groups of 3 points into the rasterization pipeline. Depending on the desired image, there may or may not be some texture that needs to be mapped to the screen space: if so, there is an associated mapping to from pixel space to texture space. In any case, raw point sampling generally leads to jagged edges and aliasing: our pixel space just isn't high resolution enough to capture all of this detail. There are a number of techniques we can use to combat this. Firstly, we can supersample by taking multiple samples within the region of one pixel, and then taking the average of the values. This is very effective the more samples you have per pixel, but can be very costly. For texture mapping, there are much more efficient ways to implement anti-aliasing. We can implement bilinear interpolation to sample pixel locations in the texture space instead of just returning the color of the nearest pixel. Furthermore, we can utilize a mip-map with decreasing resolutions of the texture: when the step size in texture space is relatively small for a step in the rendering space, we opt for a higher resolution image. When step size in texture space is relatively large, we opt for a lower resolution image to combat potential aliasing. This is a low-cost, effective way to minimize aliasing in texture mapping. Ultimately, we will explore the fundamentals of image rasterization and texture mapping, as well as techniques to reduce aliasing while maintaining efficiency.</p>
